        <p>People say I do a great job of listening and providing thoughtful leadership. It is crucial to seek input from many voices, and do so respectfully.  I love serving our citizens on city council and strive to provide a proud and thriving community by focusing on innovative and reliable ideas. Because of this, I’ve officially filed as a candidate for Mayor. </p>

        <p>I feel compelled to bring fresh leadership that will boost our local businesses, strengthen our community, support our working families, and responsibly build and maintain our infrastructure.  We must collaborate with all levels of government to lower property taxes, to create good jobs, and to solve our most pressing problems.  One role of mayor is to be a spokesperson for the citizens of Cambridge. While advocating for our city, I bring my extensive experience as an accomplished public speaker. </p>

        <p>My wife, Trina, and I chose to reside in Cambridge because it is a great place to raise children.  Paying it forward, I’ve served in many civic, professional, and church organizations, including:  City Council since 2017, Cambridge Planning Commission and Cambridge Fire Department Liaison,  Homeland Security National Incident Management System trainee, Highway 65 Corridor Commission member,  District Instructional Leadership Team leader, CIHS teacher, and more.</p>

        <p>This commitment to the community prompted friends and colleagues to encourage me to seek election as Mayor.  I  demonstrate proven leadership skills and maintain a level head.  They say I have done a great job representing the people of Cambridge with integrity. I promise to continue to do so. I look forward to talking to voters and hope to serve our community as its Mayor.  I am humbled by this opportunity and by the support of so many community members.   I hope I can earn your vote in November!</p>
